### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro) 
library(lubridate)
library(glue)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

```{r}
c("5")
c(length = 5)
c(5L)
numeric <- c("5")
character <- c(lengh = 5)
mixed <- (5L)
```
`r typeof("5")`

### Exercise 2

```{r bind_data , eval = F}
data_frame() <- bind_cols("numeric" = numeric, "character" = character, "mixed" = mixed)
```
### Exercise 3

```{r}

```


### Exercise 4

```{r label-me2, eval = F}
___ <- list("___" = numeric, "___" = character, "mixed" = ___)
my_list
```

### Exercise 5

```{r earthquakes-factors}
earthquakes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Month of the year", y = "Earthquake count")
```

### Exercise 6


```{r earthquakes-forcats-1}
earthquakes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_infreq(month))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Month of the year", y = "Earthquake count")
```

```{r earthquakes-forcats-2}
earthquakes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(month))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Month of the year", y = "Earthquake count")
```

```{r earthquakes-forcats-3}
earthquakes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_inorder(month))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Month of the year", y = "Earthquake count")
```

```{r earthquakes-forcats-4}
earthquakes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev())) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Month of the year", y = "Earthquake count")
```

```{r earthquakes-forcats-5}
earthquakes %>% 
  mutate(month = fct_recode(month,
                            "1" = "January",
                            "2" = "February",
                            "3" = "March",
                            "4" = "April",
                            "5" = "May",
                            "6" = "June",
                            "7" = "July",
                            "8" = "August",
                            "9" = "September",
                            "10" = "October",
                            "11" = "November",
                            "12" = "December")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(as.numeric(month)))) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Month of the year", y = "Earthquake count")
```

```{r lubridate, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.cap = "lubridate needs to be loaded separately, but is also part of the tidyverse", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lubridate-not-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
### Exercise 7


```{r earthquake-dates}
earthquakes_new <- earthquakes %>% 
  mutate(date = glue("{year} {month} {day}")) %>% 
  relocate(date)
print(earthquakes_new)
```

### Exercise 9
```{r earthquakes-dates2, eval = F}
earthquakes %>% 
  mutate(date = ___(glue("{year} {month} {day}"))) %>% 
  relocate(date) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = richter)) +
  geom_point() 
```
